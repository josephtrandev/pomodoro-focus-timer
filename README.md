Pomodoro Focus Timer is a tool used to optimize the time tracking process when using the Pomodoro Technique. 

It allows users to spend more time focusing on their tasks instead of worrying about keeping track of their time and breaks.

#### What is the Pomodoro Technique?

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method created in the late 1980s by Francesco Cirillo. 
Cirillo was a university student who was struggling to focus on his studies and assignments at the time. 

#### What are the steps in the Pomodoro Technique?

    1. Identify a single task to focus on (or break down larger tasks into singular tasks).
    2. Set a timer for 25 minutes and work on the task until the timer is up.
    3. When the alarm sounds, take a 5-minute break.
    4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 another three times (for a total of four cycles).
    5. Take a longer 30-minute break and start the process again.

#### What are the advantages of the Pomodoro Technique?

The Pomodoro Technique helps you hyper-focus on tasks, fight distractions, and train your brain to overcome a short attention span. 
By breaking your work into chunks and frequently giving your brain and eyes a rest, you’re encouraging yourself to be efficient and accountable in finishing your work. 

Those who try the Pomodoro Technique report increased levels of productivity during the 25-minute spans, less fatigue and mental exhaustion at the end of the day, and a confidence-boosting feeling of accomplishment when tasks are completed on (or before) time. 
Whether your task is to write a paper, knock out a proposal, complete a graphic design project, or write some complex code, you may find that breaking your work into 25-minute chunks is hugely beneficial. 
The breaks in between bursts of productivity also allow you to take a more holistic view of your project or product, spurring you to review the progress you’ve made with fresh eyes and make adjustments where necessary. 

#### What are the drawbacks of the Pomodoro Technique?

People with tasks that require longer sessions of concentration or tasks that are too short for a 25 minute work period find that the Pomodoro technique is not applicable for them. 
Another possible drawback of this method is that sometimes interruptions are nearly impossible to avoid.
